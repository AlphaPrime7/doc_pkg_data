# Intro

- This is the recipe I have used to document data for my R packages. The reason I struggled with this is because I failed to clean up my notes on making R packages and so scrambled with this issue till i finally decided to make some template I could follow each time i developed a package.

## Init

- File(s) needs to be copied into extdata before this process can be
accomplished. For R developers this should not be a problem.

## How I add my data
```{r}
fpath <- system.file("extdata", "dat_3.dat", package = "normfluodbf", mustWork = TRUE)
dat_3 <- read.table(fpath) #read data in for use with use_dat
use_data_raw(name=fpath)
usethis::use_data(dat_3)
document()
```

## Exit

- Rename prep file in data raw
